# Project Management Course

Welcome to the Project Management Course repository. This repository is dedicated to developing project management skills through hands-on experience with real-world software projects. The course covers essential aspects of project planning, execution, and control, with a focus on practical applications.

## Directory Structure

### Project

The `Project` directory houses the primary project for this course, which involves the design and implementation of a **Library Management Software**. This project serves as a comprehensive case study, allowing students to apply project management principles in a software development context.

#### Library Management Software

This project focuses on creating a robust and user-friendly Library Management System. The system is designed to meet the needs of both regular users and administrators, providing secure login functionalities, role-based access control, and reliable data management.

- **bin/**: Contains the compiled binaries, including the executable file necessary to run the software.
- **obj/**: Stores intermediate files generated during the build process, such as object files and cache data.
- **Properties/**: Includes essential configuration files and resources, such as assembly metadata and application settings.
- **Source Files**: Contains the main C# source code files, including the implementation of user controls, login forms, and the core program logic.

- **Project.sln**: The solution file for the project, used to open and manage the project in an IDE like Visual Studio.

- **README.md**: Provides documentation and instructions specific to the Library Management Software project, including setup and usage guidelines.

### How to Use

1. **Explore the Project**:
   - Navigate to the `Library Management Software` directory to access the project files. This project is structured to give you a clear understanding of how software projects are organized and managed.

2. **Understand the Structure**:
   - Review the subdirectories and files within the project to understand the role of different components, from source code to compiled binaries.

3. **Read Project Documentation**:
   - Refer to the `README.md` file within the `Library Management Software` directory for detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application.

This course provides a practical approach to learning project management by immersing you in the complete lifecycle of a software project, from planning to deployment.
